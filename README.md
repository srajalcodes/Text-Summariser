Text Summarizer


Overview

Text Summarizer is a Python application designed to generate concise summaries from input text passages. It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify key sentences and extract important information from the input text.

Functionality
The Text Summarizer application performs the following tasks:

Reads input text passages.
Processes the text using spaCy for tokenization and analysis.
Calculates word frequencies and scores each sentence based on word importance.
Selects the most significant sentences to form a summary.
Outputs the generated summary.
Usage
To use the Text Summarizer, follow these steps:

Install Python 3.x on your system if not already installed.
Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the text_summarizer.py script and provide input text passages.
The application will generate a summary based on the input text.
Example
Consider the following input text passage:

So far we have been proceeding as if we have a firm and precise grasp of the nature of AI. But what exactly is AI? Philosophers arguably know better than anyone that precisely defining a particular discipline to the satisfaction of all relevant parties (including those working in the discipline itself) can be acutely challenging. Philosophers of science certainly have proposed credible accounts of what constitutes at least the general shape and texture of a given field of science and/or engineering, but what exactly is the agreed-upon definition of physics? What about biology? What, for that matter, is philosophy, exactly? These are remarkably difficult, maybe even eternally unanswerable, questions, especially if the target is a consensus definition. Perhaps the most prudent course we can manage here under obvious space constraints is to present in encapsulated form some proposed definitions of AI. We do include a glimpse of recent attempts to define AI in detailed, rigorous fashion (and we suspect that such attempts will be of interest to philosophers of science, and those interested in this sub-area of philosophy).
